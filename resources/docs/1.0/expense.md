# Expense Management

To view and manage your expenses, navigate to the **General** section and click on the **Expenses** menu item.

## Expense Dashboard

At the top of the page, you'll find a mini-dashboard displaying key expense analytics:

- **Total Expenses**: The sum of all expenses.
- **Average Expense**: The total amount spent divided by the number of expenses.

## Expense Records

Below the dashboard, you'll find the **Expense Records** section, carefully designed with two main areas:

1. **Filter Section**  
   You can easily filter your expenses by:
   - **Category**: Select a category from the dropdown (e.g., Transport, Airtime, etc.).
   - **Status**: Filter by status, such as Pending, Approved, or Rejected.

2. **Table Section**  
   The table displays a list of all your expenses, with options to filter and interact with your records.

## Adding an Expense

To add a new expense:
1. Click the **"Add New Expense"** button located to the right of the **Expense Records** title.
2. Fill out the form that appears.
3. Click **"Create"** to submit your expense. The record will then appear in the table.

## Viewing a Receipt

If an expense includes a receipt:
- Look for a **download icon** under the **Receipt** column in the table.
- Click the icon to view or download the receipt.

## Editing or Deleting an Expense

You can edit, view, or delete any expense that hasn't been approved yet. To do so:
1. In the **Actions** column, click the ellipsis (three dots) next to the expense you want to modify.
2. Choose one of the options: **Edit**, **Delete**, or **View**.

This intuitive design ensures you can easily manage and track your expenses at any time.
